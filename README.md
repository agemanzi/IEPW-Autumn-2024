# IEPW-Autumn-2024


## Expected projects



- **Robust PV Model**  
  > The first project will introduce us to the basic workflow involving advanced Python libraries as well as energy modeling.  
  > PVlib is a cutting-edge Python library and an industry standard for both researchers and corporate environments.  
  > This initial project will equip us with a reusable PV model to be utilized later in the course.  

- **Find Break-even Point for Electricity Fixation Price vs. Spot Market Participation**  
  > The second project aims at solving an interesting question.  
  > This project should equip you with an algorithm that determines at what price and with what certainty fixation is economical compared to spot market participation.  
  > For this project, we will employ basic statistics, limited machine learning, and principles of energy modeling.

- **PV System Controls and Optimization**  
  > The last project will focus on a complex optimization task centered around the PV-Boiler-Spot plan.  
  > This project will require consumption-production modeling as well as optimization of PV boiler controls.  
  > The task will feature extensive use of machine learning, with a recommended focus on reinforcement learning.  
  > Additionally, power consumption is assumed to be time and weather dependent; therefore, machine learning for time series modeling is advised since ARIMA models are quite difficult to set up and beyond the scope of this course.
